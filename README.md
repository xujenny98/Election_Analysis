# Election_Analysis
# Project Overview and Purpose
Tom would like to conduct an accurate election report to be submitted to the Colorado Boaed of Elections.  In order for Tom to know the election results, Tom would needs to analyze election data using Python.  

# Election Audit Results
After analyzing the election data we got the following result:

<br/>*The total number of votes were casted to be 369,711. 

<br/>*The number and percentage of total votes across three counties were predicted:
<br/>Jefferson : 10.5% of votes, or 38,855 total number of votes.
<br/>Denver: 82.8% of votes, or 306,055 total number of votes.
<br/>Arapahoe: 6.7% of votes, or 24,801 total number of votes

<br/>*Denver has the largest county turnout.

<br/>*The total number and total percentage of votes across three election candaidates were:
<br/> Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% of votes, or 85,213 total number of votes.
<br/>Diana DeGette: 73.8% of votes, or 272,892 total number of votes.
<br/>Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% of votes, or 11,606 total number of votes.

<br/>*We predict Diana DeGatte would won the election with 73.8% of votes, or 272,892 total number of votes.

# Summary
<br/>The following Python script can be used, with some modification for any election. the following script "candidate_name = row[2]" and "county_name = row[1]" is to find the candidate name and county from the databse. The candidate name is in column 3, and dounty name in column 2. For example, if the candidate name was in column 5 and county name in column 4.  If we want to get the candidate name and county name from each row we can change the code to "candicate_name = row[4]" and "county_name = row[3]".
